Easy Statistica is an application for statistical analysis that implements the functions of data analysis, data management, data mining, data visualization using statistical methods. The application is built in Python using the PySide6/Qt toolkit. It uses the Pandas DataFrame class to work with data. For graphics, the matplotlib library is used.

You can download your data file in Excel or CSV format or copy the desired data columns from the file into a data table. It is now possible to use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy your data from tables to an application table for analysis.

Analysis tools include 5 sections.

Section "Basic Statistics": assessing the distribution of your data in terms of the normal distribution using several tests, including graphical methods. Also in this section you can set the confidence interval you need to evaluate the data.

Section "Statistical criteria": a set of parametric and nonparametric tests to test hypotheses in your data, allowing you to determine whether any observed effect is statistically significant or due to chance.

Section "Correlation and Regression": assessing the statistical relationship of variables and the inferred relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables in your data. Several methods are presented to assess the statistical relationship of variables. Linear and logistic (ROC curve) regressions are presented to evaluate the relationships between variables.

Section "Sample size selection": assessment of the required number of observations for inclusion in the statistical sample based on the sampling error or vice versa.

Section "Coefficients": calculation of critical values for the chi-square, Student's (T-test) and Gaussian (Z-test) tests. Calculation based on Poisson distribution.

In the "Settings" section you can configure the data output for your tasks: replacing empty cells in data, the number of significant digits.

If you need information about the methods and criteria that are implemented in the analysis tools, please go to the "FAQ" section.

In the "Reports" section, you can save your worksheet of data (before and after performing the analysis) in the required format, save the analysis results in PDF format, save graphs and plots in JPG format.
